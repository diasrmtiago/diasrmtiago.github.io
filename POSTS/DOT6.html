                            tasks and how to automate them to minimise time spent producing numbers. <br>                                            
                            Part one goes through a detailed overview of the operations relating to cashflows 
                            for a young startup (series B or earlier).<br> Part two and three will cover respectively 
                            Financial Reporting and Financial Planning.

                            On this note we are going to drill down finance tasks relating to Accounts Receivable (“AR”), 
                            i.e. inflows to be received from clients and Accounts Payable (“AP”), i.e. outflows to be paid to suppliers.

                            Cashflows are thus equal to cash inflows from clients relating to revenues net 
                            of cash outflows paid to suppliers.<br> As a reminder, <strong>a common source of mistakes in 
                            numbers is to represent both as positive numbers and subtract them; to avoid this, 
                            one should represent cash inflows as a positive number (e.g £100) and cash outflows as 
                            a negative number (e.g (£20)) and then ADD both numbers</strong> to get to cash flows (£80 = £100 + (£20)).

                            Whenever there is revenue earned, there will be an invoice sent to a

                            Operationally, it will be the bookkeeper's responsibility to do

                            generate an invoice, send it to the client and match the cash inflow to the outstanding invoice.

                                    Accounting systems such as Xero or Quickbooks automate are better suited to automate steps A and B above, 
                                    however this will break above a certain volume of invoices (likely fine for up to hundreds per month), 
                            different currencies and number of legal entities.

                            <strong>Step C:</strong> Clients do not always pay on time, so it is common to use Xero or Quickbooks to chase

                            <strong>Step D:</strong> The accounting system will receive the bank feeds for each operational bank account. The bookkeeper 
                            will manually match an inflow to an invoice (there are startups trying to automate this...).

                            First let's lay out the process that requires improvement.
                            <ul align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> supplier sends an invoice to an employee at the Company 
                                    (the one that requested the service or goods). In some companies, 
                                    this is sent to Finance who then needs to figure out who should approve it internally. 
                                    <strong> This wastes a lot of time.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> the employee may exchange several emails with the supplier 
                                    if there are mistakes in the invoice.<strong> Again, this wastes a lot of time.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> the employee then forwards the approved invoice to an email 
                                    distribution list, which forward’s emails to an Optical Recognition System (OCR) to digitalise the invoice. 
                                    This is then pushed to the accounting system (Xero below in this example)
                                    <ul align="justify">
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>There is risk that an unapproved invoices get sent to the accounting 
                                            system as the OCR as not checks in place for emails received. Even worse, they may actually end up being paid.</strong>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>    
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> there is typically a weekly pay run to pay approved invoices due. The bookkeeper needs to email the head of the finance department 
                                    the payments due so that it can approve setting up payments.<strong> Time is wasted.</strong>
                                    <ul align="justify">
                                    <li><strong>This is also not great from a cashflow perspective, as some invoices get paid ahead of their due date</strong>
                                        (e.g Friday payrun would include all invoices with due dates up until next Thursday)
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> there is one payment set up in the online banking system, 
                                    for each invoice. <strong>This is very time consuming.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bookkeeper sends an email to an approver to release the payments. 
                                    The approver then needs to login to online banking system and release each payment.<strong> You guessed...Time wasted again.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                Overall this process will take many email exchanges and lot of time wasted. <strong>In particular, setting up a payrun and releasing payments will take several hours. There is a much better way to do this.</strong> 
                             </ul>
                        </p>

                            Now let's lay out a much better process, that is almost fully automated.
                            <ul align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> supplier sends an invoice to an email distribution list. 
                                    This contains an email to an AP system (link here for what I use -  
                                    <a href="https://cp.corpayone.com/" target="_blank"><u>Corpay One</u></a>) that deals with the OCR.

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>  AP systems automatically upload invoices to the platform.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> AP systems allow to set up workflows based on different rules
                                     which are used to automatically determine the Approver of the invoice. 
                                     <Strong>Everything is automated and no time is wasted by finance or company employees.</Strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once invoice is approved it goes to the bookkeeper. <strong>There is NO risk 
                                    that an unapproved invoices get sent to the accounting system or paid. So much better.</strong> 
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bookkeeper acts as a gatekeeper to any information sent to the accounting system.
                                    If all fine, it pushes approved invoices into the system.
                                </li>
                             </ul>
                        </p>

                            It takes like 10 minutes to do the payrun (vs several hours). The final step to fully automate the process 
                            is to make payments from the AP platform (this will be available in a near future).</strong>
