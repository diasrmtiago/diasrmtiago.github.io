                            and how a finance team should be structured from a very early 
                            stage at seed level, across all stages of development (series A, B, C), 
                            up until becoming a mature company.

                        <p align="justify">
                            The purpose of a startup is to embark on a journey through time 
                            to achieve a vision. On every step along the way, there will be 
                            bumps that may shift the direction the company is heading to and 
                            jeopardise its goals.<br>
                            <strong>I have come to realise that Finance’s key purpose is to partner with 
                            people to ensure, in a helpful way, that the vision is executed (which is why I love my job). </strong>
                            <br>
                            This is achieved by providing feedback on a company’s current trajectory. Actions can then be 
                            discussed across a multi-disciplinary team, to adjust its direction.
                            By repeating this process many times, a feedback loop is created, 
                            to ensure either that the company stays on track or if a destination change is 
                            required (e.g. pivot the business so that it is sustainable ahead of scaling).
                            
                        </p>

                            In a nutshell, it is like driving a car. 
                            We need not only to turn the steering wheel whenever there 
                            is a curve to ensure we stay on the road, but also to choose 
                            where we are heading to.

                        <p align="justify">
                            The next step question then becomes, how can finance provide feedback? 
                            We need numbers for the <strong>past (financial reporting) </strong>to assess the trajectory and
                             for the <strong>future (financial planning and analysis or “FP&A”)</strong> to see where we are 
                             likely heading to.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Obviously, if the key goal is to partner with people and provide feedback, 
                            then the next pillar is to have enough time to think about what the numbers 
                            are saying and provide insights. This should be done not just from a finance perspective, 
                            but taking into account the other team’s perspective.

                            Finally, after numbers are produced and the thinking is done, 
                            it is necessary to engage with people to steer the business trajectory.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Putting everything together, I often keep in my mind the below, 
                            to help me think of the big picture and prioritise what Finance should be doing.
                         </p>  
                         <img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT5/img/D5P5.jpg" alt="..." />
                         <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 5: My Three pillars.</span>
                         <p align="justify">
                            From a value creation perspective, pillar #1 is where Finance should spend most of its time. 
                            The key issue that I have encountered, is that there is a lot of pressure to spend most of the 
                            time in the lowest value pillar (#3). This is a consequence of manual tasks and processes, using
                             Excel (data in a file is isolated) vs Google-sheets  (easy to move data around)  and not having
                              a proper end-to-end technology stack to support Finance processes (there is more than just Xero).<br>
                            My view on this is that one should be ruthless about manual tasks and automate as much as 
                            possible every single process. <strong>If Finance is spending >50% of their time producing numbers
                             there is something wrong.</strong> They should be spending a lot of their time interacting with other
                              teams, so that the Company is on the right path.
                         </p>
                         <!-- SECTION 5-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Team of Teams</h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            As previously mentioned, the combined actions of every single team will 
                            determine the final trajectory. For this to happen, there needs to be information 
                            flow across the business and a company wide view. This enables each team and person to 
                            understand how what they do on a day to day basis impacts the company path and when it is 
                            essential to coordinate with others.
                            The figure below highlights a risk that may hinder this goal. If every team is using, 
                            independently, data specific to them and not sharing it with others, it is impossible to 
                            have a group wide view and to coordinate actions that are interdependent.
                         </p>

                            <strong>Finance can add a lot of value to this process, by coordinating the information flow and creating a 
                            company wide view shared with everyone. </strong>By putting finance at the epicentre of data, i.e. each team to 
                            flow data centrally to one location, it can build this view, feedback it back accordingly and manage the 
                            overall coordination across teams. See example below.

                                 the past/present (financial reporting), others focused on the future
                                  (financial planning) and someone that will need to wear both hats (#1 
                                  finance person - either finance director or CFO).</li>
                            <li><strong>Execution:</strong> a Finance Director/CFO should be mostly thinking
                                 (pillar #2) and collaborating with the rest of business (pillar #1). The time 
                                 spent on pillar #3 (doing numbers) should be minimal. It should have a team of 
                                 direct reports, working as a layer between thinking and executing. These in turn
                                  are supported by people that are mostly focused on day to day tasks. 
                                  <strong>I am a firm believer that it is very important that everyone in the team has a very good

                            The finance needs are thus minimal, one can consider to outsource the bookkeeping but 
                            there is not much more than this required.
