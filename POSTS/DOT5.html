                            This note goes through how Finance adds value to a startup 
                            and how a finance team should be structured from a very early 
                            stage at seed level, across all stages of development (series A, B, C), 
                            up until becoming a mature company.                                                    
                        </p>                
                        <!-- SECTION 1-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Feedback Loop </h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The purpose of a startup is to embark on a journey to achieve a vision. 
                            
                            <strong>I have come to realise that Finance’s key purpose is to partner with 
                            people to ensure, in a helpful way, that the vision is executed (which is why I love my job). </strong>
                            <br>
                            This is achieved by continuously providing feedback on a company’s trajectory. Actions can then be 
                            discussed across a multi-disciplinary team, to adjust its direction.
                            By repeating this process, a feedback loop is created, 
                            to ensure either that the company stays on track or if a destination change is 
                            required (e.g. pivot the business so that it is sustainable ahead of scaling).
                            
                        </p>

                            In a nutshell, it is like driving a car. We need to turn the steering wheel 
                            not only to stay on the road, but also to choose our final destination.

                        <p align="justify">
                            The question then becomes, how can finance provide feedback?<br> 
                            Firstly, we need numbers for the <strong>past (financial reporting) </strong>to assess the current trajectory and
                             for the <strong>future (financial planning and analysis or “FP&A”)</strong> to see where we are 
                             likely heading to.

                        <p align="justify">
                            If the key goal is to partner with people and provide feedback, 
                            then the next pillar is to have enough time to think about what the numbers 
                            are saying and provide insights. This should be done not just from a finance perspective, 
                            but also taking into account the perspective of other teams.

                            Finally, after numbers are produced and the thinking is done, 
                            it is necessary to engage with people to steer the business trajectory.<br> <strong>We need to turn the wheel.</strong>

                            Putting everything together, I have come up with the below to help me 
                            think about the big picture and prioritise what Finance should be doing.

                            <strong>From a value creation perspective, pillar #1 is where Finance should spend most of its time.

                                there is something wrong.</strong> <br>
                            The key issue that I have encountered is that there is a lot of pressure to spend most of the 
                            time producing numbers. This is a mainly a consequence of:

                        <p align="justify">
                            For coordination to happen across teams, there needs to be information 
                            flow across the business and a company wide view (no silos...). 
                            If every team is using, 
                            independently, data specific to them and not sharing it with others, it is impossible to 
                            have a group wide view and coordinate actions that are interdependent.

                            If finance is instead at the epicentre of data, it can
                            coordinate the information flow and create a company wide view. 
                            <strong>It can thus add a lot of value by providing feedback on the current trajectory and 
                            managing the overall process across teams to determine actions and achieve goals.</strong>

                            A finance team starts with backward looking capabilities for day-to day tasks 
                            relating to bookkeeping, it then progresses to financial reporting with the hire 
                            of a Finance Manager (or Head of Finance). Once a Finance Director or CFO is hired (typically 
                            series B but could be sooner), the next step is to build forward looking capabilities 
                            relating to FP&A. <br>The roles in red are more typically for large and established companies, 
                            although a need to hire for these roles may appear sooner under certain circumstances (e.g.
                             international scale up or lending business).

                            The finance needs are thus minimal (mainly payroll costs), one can consider to outsource the bookkeeping if this is required.
