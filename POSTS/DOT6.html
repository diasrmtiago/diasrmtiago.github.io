                        <p align="justify">                         
                            On a previous article, I wrote: <strong>“If [finance] is instead spending >50% of 
                            their time producing numbers (pillar #3) there is something wrong.” </strong><br>
                            A leader of a Finance Team, I think it is of paramount importance to 
                            ensure that the people working with me produce work that is as valuable as 
                            possible for an organisation. 
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify"> 
                            This means being ruthless and automating as many
                             manual tasks as possible, so that they can use their time on more value-added 
                             tasks that will help them to develop as professionals and have a more meaningful role.
                            <strong>After implementing some of the things below, people in my team avoid each week two hours 
                            of manual work. Over the last two years, this has saved them more than two-hundred hours. </strong>
                            I am very proud of this.
                        </p>

                            Therefore I thought it would be of value to go through day to day finance tasks and 
                            how to automate them to minimise time spent producing numbers. This is the first note of a series of three notes. 
                            Part one goes through a detailed overview of the operations relating to cashflows for a young startup (series B or earlier).

                            We are going to drill down on finance tasks relating to Accounts Receivable (“AR”), 
                            i.e. inflows to be received from clients and Accounts Payable (“AP”), i.e. outflows to be paid to suppliers.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Cashflows are thus equal to cash inflows from clients relating to revenues net 
                            of cash outflows paid to suppliers relating to costs.<br> <strong>A common source of mistakes in 
                            numbers is to represent both as positive numbers and subtract them; to avoid this, 
                            one should represent cash inflows as a positive number (e.g £100) and cash outflows as 
                            a negative number (e.g (£20)) and then ADD both numbers</strong> to get to cash flows (£80 = £100 + (£20)).

                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> supplier sends an invoice to an employee at the Company 
                                    (the one that requested the service or goods). In some companies, 
                                    this is sent to directly to Finance who then needs to figure out who should approve it internally. 
                                    <strong> This wastes a lot of time.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> the employee may exchange several emails with the supplier 
                                    if there are mistakes in the invoice.<strong> Again, this wastes a lot of time.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> the employee then forwards the approved invoice to an email 
                                    distribution list, which forwards emails to an Optical Recognition System (OCR) to digitalise the invoice. 
                                    This is then pushed to the accounting system (Xero below in this example) by the bookkeeper.
                                    <ul align="justify">
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>There is a risk that unapproved invoices are sent to the accounting 
                                            system as the OCR as no checks in place for emails received 
                                            (it accepts emails from anyone!). Even worse, they may actually end up being paid.</strong>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> there is typically a weekly pay run to pay approved invoices on their due date. 
                                    The bookkeeper needs to email an approver the payments due and request approval to set up payments.
                                    <ul align="justify">
                                    <li><strong>This is not great from a cashflow perspective, as some invoices get paid ahead of their due date</strong>
                                        (e.g Friday payrun would include all invoices with due dates up until the following Thursday)
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> there is one payment set up in the online banking system, 
                                    for EACH invoice. <strong>This is very time consuming.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bookkeeper sends an email to an approver to release the payments. 
                                    The approver then needs to login to an online banking system and release each payment.<strong> You guessed...Time wasted again.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                Overall this process will take many email exchanges and lot of time wasted. <strong>There is a much better way to do this.</strong> 
                             </ul>

                            <img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT6/img/D6P8.jpg" alt="..." />

                            <ul align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> supplier sends an invoice to an email distribution list. 
                                    This contains an email to an AP system (link here for what I use -  
                                    <a href="https://cp.corpayone.com/" target="_blank"><u>Corpay One</u></a>) that deals with the OCR.

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>  AP systems automatically upload invoices to the platform.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> AP systems allow to set up workflows based on different rules
                                     which are used to automatically determine the Approver of the invoice. 
                                     <Strong>Everything is automated and no time is wasted by finance or company employees.</Strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once invoice is approved it goes to the bookkeeper. If the invoice is rejected
                                    the supplier is notified automatically.<br> <strong>There is NO risk 
                                    that an unapproved invoices get sent to the accounting system or paid. So much better.</strong> 
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bookkeeper acts as a gatekeeper to any information sent to the accounting system.
                                    If all fine, it pushes approved invoices into the accounting system. <strong>Lot's of time saved.</strong>
                                </li>
                             </ul>
                             Now let's move on to the process of paying approved invoices (step C).

                                <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Accounting system used to automatically provide information to Wise 
                                    on all invoices to be paid (payment details and amount).
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> One transfer set up to pay the full amount of invoices to be paid.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Once funds are received at Wise, it automatically pays each supplier individually.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <strong>The final step to fully automate the process 
                            is to make payments from the AP platform (this will be available in a near future).</strong>
