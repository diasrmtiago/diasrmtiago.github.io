                        <p align="justify">Cashflows and Profits are defined in the 
                            same way, i.e. revenues net of costs, but they 
                            are not measured on the same basis.  
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify"><strong>Cash basis:</strong> cash revenues and cash costs are based on when 
                            they are respectively received or paid.

                        <p align="justify">Let's use an example to make it easier to understand. 
                            During a certain year, a Company has the following cash transactions:
                        </p>
                        <ol align="justify">
                            <li>Cash revenues = £100 received in months 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15</li>
                            <li>Cash costs = (£30) paid in months 4, 7, 10 and 13</li>                         
                            <small>Note: Numbers in brackets are used to indicate a negative number,<br> i.e. (£30) = -£30.</small>
                          </ol>
                          <p align="justify"><strong>The Cashflows for the year would thus be £310</strong> = £400 cash revenues
                             minus £90 cash costs. Any revenue received or cost paid post month 12 
                             would not count towards the yearly figure.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify"><strong>Profit and Loss (P&L) basis:</strong> there are rules, 
                            based on different accounting standards, that stipulate when revenue is earned 
                            and when costs are incurred.
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT2/img/D2P3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3: P&L basis for Profits.</span>
                        
                        <p align="justify">
                            <strong>Cashflows can be derived from Profits if one takes into account the time impact of 
                            (i) receiving revenues vs earning them and (ii) paying costs vs incurring them, i.e.
                            <u>Cashflows = Profits + time impact. </u></strong>
                       </p>

                       <p align="justify">Going back to the previous example</p>
                       <ol align="justify">
                        <li>P&L Revenues = £100 earned in month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 (received 2 months later)</li>
                        <li>Quarterly P&L Costs = (£30) incurred per quarter, paid after quarter end</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>The Profits for the year would thus be £380</strong>  = £500 P&L revenues minus £120 P&L costs.
                    </p>
                       
                    <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT2/img/D2P4.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 4: Cashflow basis vs P&L basis.</span>

                       <p align="justify">Let's keep going through the previous example:</p>
                    <ol align="justify">
                        <li><strong>From a revenue perspective</strong>, the company received £400 cash revenues and earned £500 of revenues. 
                            <br>The time impact was thus (£100) relating to the £100 that was earned in month 12 but was
                                only received in month 15. </li>
                        <li><strong>From a cost perspective</strong>, it paid out three quarters (£90) but incurred 
                            (£120) relating to four quarters. 
                            <br>The time impact was thus £30 relating to fourth quarter costs
                                that were paid in month 13.</li>
                        
                      </ol>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>The overall time impact was thus (£70k)=(£100)+£30.</strong></p>
                      <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT2/img/D2P5.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                      <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 5: Time impact (£70) = £310-£380 = (£100) from revenues +£30 
                        from costs. </span>


                      

                    <!-- SECTION 2-->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Step 2<br>Balance Sheet = Keep a Score Sheet</h2>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        In the prior sections, we have discussed two simplified versions of 
                        the financial statements of a Company for a certain time period:
                        <ol align="justify">
                            <li><strong>Cashflows</strong> = net change in cash position for the period
                                </li>
                            <li><strong>P&L</strong> = cumulative profit or loss for period</li>
                        </ol>    
                    </p> 
                    
                    
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        To tie everything together we need to introduce a third financial statement, 
                        called the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>.</p> 

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Let’s connect sports and accounting (ugh how is that possible?).</br></br>
                        Pick any sport you like that has two teams 
                         and think about the beginning of the match: nothing has happened and therefore there is no score. 
                        Over time each team will score points and the Score Sheet is updated accordingly. 
                         At the end of the match there will be a final Score Sheet, which
                          includes the sum of all the points scored for each team. </br><strong>A Balance Sheet works the same, and at any moment in time 
                          it provides a snapshot of the running score between two teams (albeit the score,
                           or balance, is shown in a slightly different way). </br>There are four fundamental archetypes 
                           that can be used to cover the vast majority of transactions in a Company. </strong>
                           
                        </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>Archetype #1: Revenues</strong><br>
                         Going back to the original example in this note, what would the final Score Sheet
                         look like for each revenue "team" at the end of the year (month 12)?
                            <strong></strong>
                            </p>
                       
                    <center>TEAM CASH REVENUES score = £400 </br>vs TEAM P&L REVENUES score = £500</center>
                    <p align="justify">
                        TEAM P&L REVENUES thus wins the game by a margin of £100. In accounting terms however, 
                        the overall Score Sheet or Balance Sheet is shown in a slightly different way 
                        (after all this is accounting stuff…):</br>
                        <center>TEAM CASH REVENUES score of £400 + £100 = </br>
                            TEAM P&L REVENUES score  £500</center>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        The <strong>Score Sheet (i.e. Balance Sheet)</strong> for the game is shown as:
                    </p>
                    <ul align="justify"> 
                    
                        <li> <strong>Assets</strong> - (i) cash and assets that will 
                    convert into cash in the future, 
                    (ii) cash paid upfront for costs incurred over time and 
                    (iii) assets paid upfront that are used to generate future revenues</li>
                    <li><strong>Liabilities</strong> - (i) amounts that will have to be paid in the future,
                    (ii) cash received upfront for revenues not earned yet and
                    (iii) cash received upfront relating to external debt raises from investors
                </li>
                        
                    <li><strong>Equity</strong> - balancing item 
                        to make sure that the equation below balances </li>                        
                        </ul>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        <center><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></center></br>
                            Notice that this can be re-written as below:
                            <center><strong></br>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</strong></center>
                                      
                        </p> 

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Equity is thus the residual claim that 
                    Shareholders have on a Company's Assets net of its Liabilities. Whatever is left 
                    is owed to them, to compensate for the risk taken to invest in the Company. 
                </br><strong>Equity may be a negative figure</strong>, when losses incurred over time are greater than the 
                    initial Equity investment from Shareholders - in this situation the Company is 
                    <strong>insolvent</strong> which is a red flag. When this happens it is very likely that within 12 months,
                    the Company runs out of <strong>cash to pay the bills</strong>. <br>
                    To put it in another way, Runway is equivalent to when 
                    the Company runs out of cash and the Equity position is a forward looking indicator of when this will likely happen. 
                    The Balance Sheet can thus be analysed to determine the financial strength of a Company. </strong>

                    Coming back to the example at the start of this note, for Archetype #1 (Revenues), the Score Sheet for the game (i.e. the Balance Sheet) would be

                                <li>Assets were split into two lines: 
                                    <br>(i) <strong>current assets (CA)</strong>: assets to be converted into cash 
                                    or cash paid upfront for costs to be incurred, both within 12 months

                                    within 12 months or cash received upfront for revenues to be earned within 12 months
                                    <br>(ii) <strong>non current liabilities</strong>: amounts owed that will take 
                                    more than 12 months to be paid (very rare to be paid upfront >1 year of revenues)

                            <Strong>The difference between CA and CL is called "Net Current Assets" or "Working Capital". </Strong>
                            When Assets increase, Cashflows decrease, 
                            therefore whenever Working Capital increases, Cashflows will reduce.<br>

                            At the start the period WC = 0 = CA - CL; at the end of the period WC = £100 - £30 = £70. 
                            Since WC increased by £70, Cashflows must have decreased by the same amount.
                            Does this number look familiar? <br>
                            <strong>Hopefully yes… the change in WC of £70 is the time impact of Profits vs Cashflows:

                        <p align="justify"><strong>Why is Current Assets minus Current Liablities called Working Capital?</strong><br>
                            The figure below is plotting the cumulative Profits and Cashflows on a monthly basis between 
                            month 1 and month 15.<br>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 11: Delta between Profits and Cashflows = Working Capital .</span>
                            If revenues were received as soon as they were earned, and costs were paid as soon as they were
                            incurred, the pink line for the cash position over time would exactly match the green line for the cumulative Profits. <br>
                            There is typically a delay between (i) earning and receiving revenues (Current Asset) and 
                            (ii) incurring and paying for costs (Current Liability), and as a consequence the cash position 
                            ends up being lower (unless the Company is able to be paid upfront for revenues not earned yet,
                            in which case the cash position could be higher).
                            The delta between the two lines represents cash tied up in the Company's operations that cannot be used to pay
                            the bills <strong>(profits cannot be used to pay an invoice, only cash can be used for a payment, i.e.
                            cash pays the bills)</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>Replace the words "cash" by "Capital" and "operations" by "Working" and reverse the order and you get to what 
                            is called Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.</strong> 
                            <br>Notice that in month 15 the delta between both lines collapses to zero because there
                             are no more revenues or costs to be received or paid. 
                             This implies that the Company would cease operations; in practice what would happen is 
                             that it would continue to generate revenues and incurs costs (with delays to receive and pay) 
                             and there would be an ongoing Working Capital level. <br>

                            i) Cash revenues received upfront for revenues not earned yet (think SaaS

                                There is a slightly different version of the prior archetype. 
                                This relates to when cash is spend to purchase an asset that will be used for 
                                several years to generate additional cashflows. <br>
                                In this situation, the cash cost is
                                    called "Capital Expenditure" or "Capex". If we use the same example, cashflows decreased by e.g £100.
                                 In the Balance Sheet, cash decreases by the same amount and non-current assets 
                                 (since it relates to more than one year) 
                                 increase by £100. <br>

                    Given that the cash spent on the new asset, shows up in the Balance Sheet as a non-current asset, 
                    the equation that relates
                    Cashflows to Profits needs to be updated to include "Capex", as this is not picked up by the change in Working 
                    Capital. <br>

                        There were a considerable amount of topics covered here to build intuition and 
                        the foundations required for advanced topics.
                        <br><strong>If there is one thing to remember, is that Profits is different
                        from Cashflows and that the relationship between both can be described by a 
                        simple equation that takes into account
                        the impact of time:</strong><br>

                        <p align="justify"> Why go through the hassle of explaining all this? <br>
                            These concepts set the foundations required to understand 
                        a future note, which will cover different types of business models and how important it is to be able to
                        connect Profits to Cashflows, in order to determine how easy (or not) it is to scale a Company from a Cashflow
                        perspective.
