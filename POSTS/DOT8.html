                            In a nutshell, Financial Planning should be used to support thoughtful discussions 
                            with people across a business, to steer a company towards a 
                            destination aligned with its vision (see note 
                            <a href="http://dotslog.com/POSTS/DOT5.html" target="_blank">Turn the Wheel</a>),
                            with as few numbers as possible. <br>
                            It then entails working backwards, thinking about what will break 
                            along the way and fixing it ahead of time to ensure the business can 
                            grow with minimal constraints.

                            I find it very helpful to distil Finance into two key buckets.<br> 
                            <strong>Bucket #1 (“Day to day”):</strong> this was covered in the last two notes and is all backward looking. 
                            The most senior finance person should ideally spend 30% (or less) of their time on this bit and 
                            should be responsible for building a high performing finance team that delivers operationally 
                            what is required to run a business on a day to day basis. 
                            <br>
                            <strong>Bucket #2 (“Steering the ship”): </strong>the remaining ~70% (and the focus of this note) 
                            relates to partnering  (see #1 below) with people across a business to grow it sustainably. 
                            It is all about using the past to think about the future (see #2), translating a vision into 
                            numbers for a sustainable business (see #3),  setting up milestones over the years (see #4) and 
                            determine how much capital is required (see #5).  
                         </p>
                        <!-- #1-->

                        <p align="justify">
                            I have a build  model (see 
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_w4PERKhPUmhWykGtBr4VozyiQtArvUyi4xHwWmMak/edit#gid" target="_blank">here</a>) to backup all these numbers that will be 
                            discussed in this note, however you will notice that there will be no discussions 
                            around a complex spreadsheet. This was intentional. Financial Planning should be used to 
                            support founders/leadership to understand the current trajectory and to make decisions to steer 
                            the business towards certain milestones (e.g. grow 3x next year) and their vision.<br>
                            Therefore, even though there will be a lot of details behind, when engaging in a discussion with 
                            this group of people, there should be as few numbers as possible. <br>
                            <strong>Ideally, the model should be dynamic enough to allow for live discussions of the impact
                             of different assumptions, to facilitate better decisions in real time.</strong>

                        <p align="justify">
                            It is really important to ensure that the structure of the financial reporting 
                            is set up in a way that helps to build a business plan to think about the future. 
                            This starts by splitting Costs into two main buckets: People Costs and Non People Costs.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT8/img/D8P2.jpg" alt="..." />

                        <p align="justify">
                            The next step entails further splitting each of 
                            these two buckets into Contribution Margin Costs (see previous note 
                            <a href="http://dotslog.com/POSTS/DOT1.html" target="_blank">Dot #1</a>) and Other Costs. 
                            The word “servicing” relates to any costs directly 
                            linked to revenues (contribution margin), which can include people like sales and client 
                            support and other non people costs such as marketing. 
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT8/img/D8P3.jpg" alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3: Contribution Margin Costs and Other Costs.</span>
                        <p align="justify">
                            Finally, the financial reporting is structured as follows:
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">
                            With this structure in place, it is easier to drill down on the operational drivers 
                            for CM unit economics and link a financial goal (e.g. CM > Other Costs) with operational milestones 
                            (e.g. grow revenues ~20x in 3 years or decide on the hiring plan).
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">
                            <strong>It is of paramount importance to ensure that unit economics makes 
                            sense before actually scaling the business</strong> (see previous note 
                            <a href="http://dotslog.com/POSTS/DOT3.html" target="_blank">Digging out of a hole</a>). <br>
                            Lets thus drill down on the drivers for the Contribution Margin - 
                            these will vary depending on the business model and product, hence 
                            we are going to analyse a simple business as per the example below.
                        </p>

                            To determine if the business is sustainable before scaling it, 
                            is it necessary to establish if the current CM loss of (83%) is temporary or 
                            structural (always negative).<br> 
                            In this case, there is a path to get to a <strong>run-rate contribution margin of ~40% 
                            if servicing costs capacity is fully utilised </strong> (~25 new clients per month).

                                </li>
                                <li>Commission is 10% of revenues generated (~12% grossed up for taxes).</li>
                                <li>The company currently has one person supporting new clients with a base salary of £50k. 
                                    This person can support up to 25 new clients per month.</li>
                                <li>Other servicing costs of £5k stay fixed for up to 25 new clients per month.</li>
                                <li>There are further marketing costs of £2k to acquire each new client.</li>

                            The case for a structurally unsustainable business is shown below. 
                            If the current fee of £7.5k was a blip and was expected to decrease to around £4k it 
                            would be impossible to become CM positive.

                            During the growth stage, it will not be possible to have a perfect match 
                            between revenues and CM costs. This is because it will be necessary to incur additional 
                            costs beforehand (e.g. hire more servicing people) which will drive margins below the 
                            run-rate level. Furthermore, for a young startup (series A to C) it is very unlikely

                            Notice that if Other Costs had remained flat, breakeven would have occurred ~6 months 
                            earlier when revenues hit ~£215k (~15x). Even more importantly, this would have allowed 
                            the company to not run out of cash (see #5 below).

                            When would the company need to raise? 
                            Would it have access to other sources of funding (e.g. venture debt) in addition to equity?<br>
                            As it can be seen in the figure below, for the Other Cost flat scenario (green curve), 
                            the Dec-22 cash position of £1.6m would have allowed the business to be funded until breakeven.  
                            <br>
                            This is not the case when Other Costs increase. There would be a ~£0.7m 
                            funding gap that would have to be financed by Q3-24.

                        it is very helpful to be able to compare key outputs. This is possible to achieve by making 
                        the model circular as follows. (see tab “ExampleIterations” in the
