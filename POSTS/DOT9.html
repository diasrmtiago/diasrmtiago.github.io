                            <strong>The value of a startup, on a fundamental level, is driven by the combination of two key levers: 
                            i) how big are its future cashflows and ii) how risky are they.  </strong><br><br>
                            Regarding first lever, when a company is very young, it is almost impossible 
                            to assess what these will be, hence is it a common practice to use a proxy for 
                            valuation based on operational metrics or simply the founders & team as per below. 
                            As the company grows, the metrics used for valuation become increasingly financial 
                            and based on forward looking multiples (e.g x times revenues of the following year).

                            For the second lever, I find it helpful to think about risk associated to cashflows as an intrinsic 
                            factor to the startup and the returns required for investors to accept that risk as 
                            an extrinsic factor as per the figure below.

                            Let's start to lay out the foundations. 
                        </p>
                        <!-- Start-->
                         <h2 > Scenario #1: transaction with no risk</h2>
                         <p align="justify">                         
                            Imagine a scenario where you have a member of your family who has a £1 coin in
                             their hand and that it wants to sell this asset to you. What would you be willing to pay for it? 
                            As there is no risk of not receiving the £1 coin (immediate transaction & low risk seller),
                             you could consider any price up to £1. <br>
                            However there are two parties in this transaction: a buyer (you) and a seller (your family member). 
                            For an exchange to happen, both parties need to agree to a price (or valuation for the asset). <br>
                            From the seller's perspective, if he accepts anything below £1 he is making a loss. 
                            <strong>As a consequence, this transaction would occur with an agreed value of £1.</strong>
                         </p>

                        <!-- Start-->
                        <h2 > Scenario #2: transaction with low risk</h2>
                            <p align="justify">                         
                                Let’s assume instead a 1 month gap between paying the seller a 
                                certain amount and receiving the £1 coin.<br> 
                                Now you are worried that something could happen during the one month 
                                period that prevents delivery of the £1 (e.g. lose the coin).  
                                You thus think there is a certain risk in the transaction and translate this 
                                as a certain probability that the seller does not deliver the coin. 
                                For example, if there is a 5% probability of receiving nothing, then the 
                                expected outcome is a £0.95 payout (5% x £0 plus 95% x £1). <br>
                                This investment (or transaction) would occur with an agreed value of £0.95.
                                 <strong>If you do end up being paid £1, the £0.95 yields a return of £0.05 or about ~ 
                                 5% for the risk taken. </strong>
                                 <strong>Notice that as soon as there is some risk involved, what an 
                                    investor is willing to pay today (invest) to receive cashflows in the future decreases.</strong>                                
                            </p>

                           <h2 > Scenario #3: transaction with higher risk</h2>
                            <p align="justify">                         
                                Imagine now that you need to do a transaction with a complete stranger. 
                                In this situation, given the lack of information about the seller, you are worried 
                                not only about the one month time period but also their profile. You thus think 
                                this is a riskier transaction than before and assess the probability of not 
                                receiving anything as 10% (5% for the 1 month time gap and 5% for seller’s profile).<br> 
                                <strong>This transaction would occur with an agreed value of £0.90. If you do end up being 
                                paid £1, the £0.90 yields a return of £0.1 or about ~ 11% for the risk taken.<br>
                                Notice how a higher risk translated into a higher required return, which 
                                translated into an even lower price (or valuation) paid today.</strong>

                                The prior scenarios are meant to illustrate that an investor’s willingness to buy 
                                (cash outflow) an asset today, for a certain amount of money (i.e. valuation), is 
                                linked to the expectation of receiving higher cash inflows from that asset in the future to 
                                compensate for the risk taken.<strong> <br> In short, the higher the required return is for future cashflows,
                                 the less an investor is willing to pay today for such an investment.</strong>

                                This is a corollary for the <strong>time value of money</strong>, i.e. 
                                £1 today is worth more than £1 in the future because it 
                                can be invested with a certain risk adjusted return.

                            The value of a startup is thus the combination of two key levers: 
                            i) how big are the future cashflows (how many £1 coins in the future) 
                            and ii) how risky are they (what is the required return).

                            As explained in prior notes, Cashflows = Revenues + Costs, so let's start with revenues. 
                            
                            <strong>The first step is to figure out how big can revenues become - £10m - £1bn?</strong>

                            The second driver for the number of clients is if the product has a hardware/physical 
                            component or not. A lending business or a Software as a Service (“Saas”) business are 
                            both much higher volumes than selling houses in the London real estate market.

                            I look at costs split between Contribution Margin Costs and Other 
                            Costs because it simplifies the thinking.

                         <p align="justify">                         
                            The quality of the cashflows is firstly determined by the quality of 
                            revenues and there are several factors that can used to assess this:
                        </p>
                        <ul align="justify">
                            <li><strong>Contractual:</strong> are revenues locked in through a long term contract? 
                                E.g. Sign a 5 year contract with an annual spend of £1k</li>
                            <li><strong>Recurring or transactional:</strong> once a new client is won, does he keep 
                                buying the product for a certain (unknown) time period or it is a one off? E.g. 
                                Client pays each month $20 and typically keeps doing this for up to 5 years vs estate agent selling a property</li>
                            <li><strong>Riskless:</strong>  is there a potential unknown liability or loss associated with the revenues? 
                                E.g. Insurance premium - for some clients there will be claims associated or losses on a loan</li>
                            <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> is demand strong only for a portion of the year? E.g. Car rentals in the summer</li>
                        </ul>   
                        <p align="justify">                         
                         <strong>   If we apply this framework to the previous example, it is clear that the business #1 has the worst profile.</strong>

                        <p align="justify">                         
                            The other factor for the quality of the cashflows relates to CM costs:
                        </p>
                        <ul align="justify">
                            <li><strong>CM %:</strong> how high is the run-rate CM %? The higher the better</li>
                            <li><strong>Variable:</strong> is there a high proportion of variable CM costs? 
                                This protects cashflows if revenues decrease</li>
                            <li><strong>Volatile:</strong> how volatile are the unit prices for the fixed CM costs?
                                 If high and completely independent from revenues, some sort of protection
                                  (hedging) is required</li>
                            <li><strong>Spending gap:</strong> what is the time gap between incurring CM costs to generate
                                 revenues (cash out) and receiving the revenues (cash inflow)? If high it
                                  makes it hard to assess profitability and may have a negative working 
                                  capital effect</li> 
                            <li><strong>Cost pass-through:</strong> when CM costs increase is it possible to pass on to 
                                customers the incremental cost in order to protect CM?</li>
                        </ul>   
                        <p align="justify">                         
                            <strong>If we apply this framework to the previous example, it is very clear that the business #3 
                            has the highest quality cashflows.</strong>

                            This is all about how young or not the start up is as per the figure below. 
                            An angel / series A is a much higher risk investment than a mature company, 
                            not only because of the uncertainty related to the product and market fit, but 
                            also because of how many things can go wrong that may prevent it from growing. 
                            <strong>In other words it is very unlikely that it will become an unicorn.</strong><br> Investors will thus 
                            require much higher returns to compensate for higher expected losses, which 
                            coupled with negative cashflows implies a much lower valuation.

                            Let’s start by considering two investments as per the figure below. 
                            Both have the same risk but the return is different: 5% and 10% respectively 
                            for investment #1 and #2.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">                         
                            Any investor would prefer investment #2, given that it has better risk adjusted returns. 
                            Furthermore, there is also what is called an <strong>arbitrage opportunity</strong> - someone could sell 
                            investment #1 (short selling) and use the proceeds to buy investment #2 in order to generate 
                            an infinite return.
                        </p>

                            Therefore for investment #1 to attract capital from investors, it would 
                            have to yield the same 10% return as investment #2. In other words, its 
                            price (or valuation) would have to decrease in order to eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.

                            This is part of the reason why valuations change over time. As capital markets 
                            investors require a higher (lower) return for a certain investment risk relating to 
                            future cashflows, valuations (i.e. prices today) will decrease (increase).

                        <h3> #4 Economic Conditions<br> Why do these drive changes in capital market conditions?</h3>

                        <p align="justify">                         
                            <strong>This is the other part of the reason why valuations change over time - economic conditions 
                            change interest rates and therefore capital market conditions. </strong>I will try to keep 
                            this section short and simple as it is a fairly complex topic. <br>
                            For an economy to function it needs fiat money, which is a government-issued currency 
                            that is not backed by a physical asset. 
                            Central banks from that government control how much money there is in an economy 
                            and its cost, in line with a certain target inflation (typically ~2%). <br>  
                            If inflation is too high (like in 2022 and 2023), they will start to increase the cost 
                            of money (i.e. interest rates) and decrease the amount of money in order to decrease inflation. 
                            If inflation is too low or there is a big recession, they will do the opposite  in order to
                             help to deleverage the economy and increase economic activity. For example, during the 
                             2008 crisis, interest rates decreased to zero / negative and there was a massive increase 
                             in the amount of money (i.e. quantitative easing). <br>
                            <strong>Therefore, economic conditions impact central bank policies which then impact interest rates. 
                            These changes in interest rates will make capital markets investors adjust their 
                            returns expectations and thus impact capital markets conditions (valuations).</strong>
