                            Key concepts are explained in this note, which set the

                        <p align="justify">Cashflows and Profits are defined in the 
                            same way, i.e. revenues net of costs, but they 
                            are not measured on the same basis.

                            revenues and costs based on when they are respectively received (cash revenues) or paid (cash costs).

                        <p align="justify">Let's use an example to make it easier to understand. 
                            During a certain year, a Company has the following cash transactions:
                        </p>
                        <ol align="justify">
                            <li>Cash revenues client 1 = £100 received in month 3</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 2 = £100 received in month 6</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 3 = £100 received in month 9</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 4 = £100 received in month 12</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 5 = £100 received in month 15</li>
                            <li>Costs Costs = (£30) paid in month 4; (£30) paid in month 7;(£30) paid in month 10
                                 and (£30) paid in month 13</li>                         
                          </ol>
                          <p align="justify"><strong>The Cashflows for the year would thus be £310</strong> = £400 cash revenues
                             minus £90 cash costs. Any revenue (cost) received (paid) post month 12 does not count towards the yearly figure.
                           In this example, the <strong>£100 cash revenues from client 5 in month 15 and 
                            the (£30) cash costs in month 13 would be excluded.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify"><strong>Profit and Loss (P&L) basis:</strong> there are rules, 
                            based on different accounting standards, that stipulate when revenue is earned 
                            and when costs are incurred.
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT2/img/D2P3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

                        <p align="justify">
                            <strong>Cashflows can be derived from Profits if one takes into account the time impact of 
                            (i) receiving revenues vs earning them and (ii) paying costs vs incurring them, i.e.
                            <u>Cashflows = Profits + time impact. </u></strong>
                       </p>

                       <p align="justify">Going back to the previous example</p>
                       <ol align="justify">
                        <li> P&L Revenue client 1 = £100 earned in month 1 (received in month 3)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 2 = £100 earned in month 3 (received in month 6)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 3 = £100 earned in month 6 (received in month 9)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 4 = £100 earned in month 9 (received in month 12)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 5 = £100 earned in month 12 (received in month 15) </li>
                        <li>Quarterly P&L Costs = (£30) incurred per quarter paid after quarter end</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>The profit for the year would thus be £380</strong>  = £500 P&L revenues minus £120 P&L costs.
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 4: Cashflow basis vs P&L basis.</span>

                       <p align="justify">Let's keep going through the previous example:</p>
                    <ol align="justify">
                        <li><strong>From a revenue perspective</strong>, the company received £400 cash revenues (client 5 was paid after year end) 
                            and earned £500 of revenues from 5 clients. 
                            <strong>The time impact was thus (£100) relating to the £100 from client 5 that were received in month 15. </strong></li>
                        <li><strong>From a cost perspective</strong>, it paid out three quarters (£90) but incurred 
                            (£120) relating to four quarters. 
                            <strong>The time impact was thus £30 relating to fourth quarter costs that were paid in month 13. </strong> </li>
                        
                      </ol>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>The overall time impact was thus (£70k)=(£100)+£30.</strong></p>

                    <!-- SECTION 2-->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Balance Sheet > Keep a Score Sheet</h2>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        In the prior sections, we have discussed two simplified versions of 
                        the financial statements of a Company for a certain time period:
                    </p> 
                    <ol align="justify">
                        <li><strong>Cashflows</strong> = net change in cash position for the period
                            </li>
                        <li><strong>P&L</strong> = profit or loss for period</li>
                                              </ol>
                    
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        To tie everything together we need to introduce a third financial statement, 
                        called the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>.</p> 

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Let’s connect sports and accounting (ugh how is that possible?).</br></br>
                        Pick any sport you like that has two teams 
                         and think about the beginning of the match: nothing has happened and therefore there is no score. 
                        Over time each team will score points and the Score Sheet is updated accordingly. 
                         At the end of the match there will be a final Score Sheet, which
                          includes the sum of all the points scored for each team. </br><strong>A Balance Sheet works the same, and at any moment in time 
                          it provides a snapshot of the running score between two teams (albeit the score,
                           or balance, is shown in a slightly different way). </br>There are four fundamental archetypes 
                           that can be used to cover the vast majority of transactions in a Company. </strong>
                           
                        </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>Archetype #1 > Revenues</strong>
                                                </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                         Going back to the example earlier in this note, what would the running score 
                         look like for each revenue "team" at the end of the year (month 12)?
                            <strong></strong>
                            </p>
                       
                    <center>TEAM CASH REVENUES score = £400 </br>vs TEAM P&L REVENUES score = £500</center>
                    <p align="justify">
                        TEAM P&L REVENUES thus wins the game by a margin of £100. In accounting terms however, 
                        the overall game score or balance sheet is shown in a slightly different way 
                        (after all this is accounting stuff…):</br>
                        <center>TEAM CASH REVENUES score of £400 + £100 = </br>
                            TEAM P&L REVENUES score  £500</center>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        The <strong>Score Sheet (i.e. Balance Sheet)</strong> for the game is shown as:
                    </p>
                    <ul align="justify"> 
                    
                        <li> <strong>Assets</strong> - cash or assets that will 
                    convert into cash at the bank in the future</li>
                    <li><strong>Liabilities</strong> - amounts that will have to be paid from cash at the bank in the future </li>
                        
                    <li><strong>Equity</strong> - balancing item 
                        to make sure that the equation below balances </li>                        
                        </ul>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        <center><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></center></br>
                            Notice that this can be re-written as below:
                            <center><strong></br>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</strong></center>
                                      
                        </p> 

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Equity can thus be interpreted as the residual claim that 
                    Shareholders will have on a Company's Assets net of its Liabilities. Whatever is left 
                    would be owed to them, to compensate for the risk they took when they invested in the Company. 
                </br>Note that <strong>Equity may be a negative figure</strong>, which means that the losses incurred over time are greater than the 
                    initial Equity investment from Shareholders - in this situation the Company is 
                    <strong>insolvent</strong> which is a red flag. Soon after, it will likely become
                <strong>iliquid</strong>, which means that it will run out of 
                    cash</strong> and become bankrupt.
                    
                    </p> 
                    <p align="justify"> 
                                            Coming back to the example, for this Archetype, the Score Sheet for the game (i.e. the Balance Sheet) would be 
                                            rewritten as (see all financial statements further below):
                        <center><strong>£400 Cash + £100 Asset = £500 Equity</strong></center>
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 6: Three financial statements for Archetype #1 (Revenues).</span>
                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>Archetype #2 > Costs</strong></br>
                        Let's repeat the exercise for TEAM CASH COSTS vs TEAM P&L COSTS:
                        </p>
                    <ol align="justify">
                            <li>Team P&L costs balance = -£120</li>
                            <li>Team cash costs balance = -£90</li>
                            <li>Net balance = -£30 = -£120+£90</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p align="justify">
                        The net balance of (£30) can be interpreted as an amount owed by the 
                        Company that will need to be paid at a future date. </br><strong> In other
                         words, this is a liability of £30</strong>. 
                        </p>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Again, if we write the score (or balance sheet) for the game, we get to 
                        <center><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></br>                      
                        <strong>-£90 cash = £30 liabilities -£120 Equity</strong></center></br>
                    In this archetype, the financial statements would look like the below.

                        The examples above, describe two fundamental archetypes 
                        that are used as building blocks to produce the financial 
                        statements of a Company (the other two are described in appendix). 
                        Let's put this to use in the original example by simply adding up the two archetypes.

                        As mentioned earlier in this note, from a P&L and Cashflows perspective 
                        we get respectively to £380 and £310. The time impact of -£70 
                        (-£100+£30) is simply the consequence of increasing assets by £100, which has a negative 
                        impact in Cashflows as the cash inflow will occur later, and of increasing liabilities by £30, 
                        which has a positive impact in Cashflows as the cash outflow will be paid later.
                    </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Time Impact = Change in Working Capital</h2>
                        <p align="justify">You may have heard in the past the term “Working Capital” and 
                            searched online the term to get the below:  
                        </p>
                        <q>The capital of a business which is used in its day-to-day trading operations, 
                            calculated as the current assets minus the current liabilities</q>
                            <p align="justify">Clear as mud right?<br>
                                The following figure is replicating the balance sheet from the previous section, with two small changes:
                                
                            </p>
                        <ol align="justify">
                                <li>Assets were split into two lines: (i) <strong>current assets (CA)</strong> which means 
                                    assets that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months after 
                                    the end of the period and (ii) <strong>non current assets</strong> which means assets that will 
                                    take more than 12 months to be converted to cash.</li>
                                <li>Liabilities were split into two lines: (i) <strong>current liabilities (CL) </strong>which means 
                                    amounts owed that are expected to be paid within 12 months after the end of the 
                                    period and (ii) <strong>non current liabilities </strong>which means amounts owed that will take 
                                    more than 12 months to be paid.
                                </li>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 9: Balance Sheet with split between current and noncurrent.</span>

                        <p align="justify">At the start the period CA = 0 and CL = 0 hence Working Capital 
                            (CA - CL) was zero. However at the end of the period, CA increased to £100 and 
                            CL increased to £30 hence working capital was £70. 
                            Does this number look familiar? <br>
                            <strong>Hopefully yes… this figure is the increase in working capital for the period,
                                 £70-0 = £100 impact 
                            from revenues net of £30 impact from costs.  </strong>

                        <p align="justify">Just to wrap it up - why is this called Working Capital?<br>
                            If we look at archetype one (revenues) there is a £100 asset that will be 
                            converted into  cash in the future. But only <STRONG>cash pays the bills</STRONG>, an asset 
                            cannot be used for this, hence Company has to use its current cash at the bank which 
                            will temporarily reduce its Cashflows until the moment in time when it gets paid the £100. 
                        <STRONG>It works as a drag on Cashflows and more capital (i.e. cash) is tied up in the business.</STRONG></BR>
                            If we look at archetype two (cost) there is a £30 liability that will be converted into a cash outflow. 
                            This increases Cashflows as the Company benefits from not having to pay this amount yet. 
                            <STRONG>It works as a booster on Cashflows and less capital (i.e. cash) is tied up in the business.</BR>
                            Overall, Working Capital just means cash tied up and its impact on Cashflows is driven by these two opposite effects.</STRONG>

                        <p align="justify">The remaining two archetypes relate to situations when 
                            either i) Revenue is received before it was actually earned (think SaaS 
                            business where a subscription is paid one year upfront) or ii) Cost is 
                            paid before it was actually incurred (think that you are the client to 
                            the SaaS business).
                            In both cases, there is no P&L impact since there is 
                            no revenue earned or cost incurred:

                                <li><strong>Archetype Three (receive cash before earning revenues):</strong> 
                                    Cashflows increases by e.g £100. In the Balance Sheet cash 
                                    goes up by the same amount and liabilities increase by £100, 
                                    given that the Company has not provided yet the product or service relating to the cash revenues.

                                     In the Balance Sheet cash decreases by the same amount and assets increase by £100, given
