                            Concrete experiences are key for people to relate to numbers and understand 
                            foundational mathematical concepts. In particular, they allow children to interact 
                            much sooner in their life with mathematics and use them to learn about the World. <br>
                            <strong>A good feeling emerges from such experiences, when something new is learnt. As a consequence a

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Beauty of Numbers (Mathematics) </h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            A long time ago, when I was in University, 
                            I unfortunately experienced many times how some of my dear colleagues 
                            were struggling with mathematics - they could not understand the 
                            intuition behind the numbers. 
                            This led to memorising things to pass a test and no real learning…. 
                            I helped them on many occasions, but afterwards I often wondered, what was 
                            blocking their ability to see the “picture” behind an equation and understand 
                            the beauty of mathematics.<br>
                            <strong>What is this beauty one might ask? In my mind, mathematics is a tool 
                            to create an abstract model of the World. If we understand the model and 
                            how it applies to concrete applications, we learn not only how to think about 
                            World, but more importantly, how we can make it a better place for our children 
                            and future generations. </strong>I find it fascinating that mankind’s progress 
                            is built on numbers: without it there would be no advancement.<br>
                            Fast forward to today and my son Santiago will soon turn four. 
                            I often think about his education and ask the same question: what can I do to help 
                            him see the “picture” behind numbers? I am hoping the below will help me to 
                            support him in this journey.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Deep Time Walk</h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            I recently came across a podcast called 
                            <a href="https://www.thelongtimeacademy.com/" target="_blank">Long Time Academy</a> 
                            (I highly recommended it, in particular the point about thinking about future generations 
                            in today’s decisions), where they discussed an experience called 
                            <a href="https://www.deeptimewalk.org" target="_blank">Deep Time Walk</a>. 
                             
                            In it, they explain how Earth is 4,600 million years old and how from this long time perspective,
                             the last 100 years are just a blink of an eye (they equate to 0.00000002% of all time elapsed so far). 
                             Furthermore, they mention how people struggle to relate to 0.00000002% if they are simply told the figure. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT4/img/D4P1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 1: Earth is 4.6 billion years old.</span>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The podcast then suggests going for a walk of 4,600 metres.
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT4/img/D4P2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 2: 1 metre = 1 million years.</span>                     

                        <p align="justify">
                            On average it will take about one hour to do the walk, which means the last metre 
                            takes approximately ONE second to cover, with ONE step. But that very last step equals 
                            the last one million years, a tiny bit of the step (10cm) equates to 100,000 years and a 
                            very, very tiny bit of the step (1cm) equates to 1,000 years.<br>
                            <strong> This then makes the last 100 years 
                            (the 0.00000002%) a very concrete experience that people can relate to, and understand how 
                            short 100 years are, in the grand scheme of things 
                            (and how quickly we are damaging the World for future generations...)</strong>. 
                            <br>My next thought was that this experience works for both adults and children. 
                            I was wondering if there were other “experiences” out there similar to this one?

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Maria Montessori</h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            In the second step in my journey, I randomly found in a bookstore, Maria Montessori’s book. 
                            In it, the famous author describes how through using their hands, children aged 3-6 years learned
                             how to write words as they picked up wooden letters and how they tried to figure out what 
                             (A+B+C)<sup>3</sup> equates to by using wooden tri-dimensional blocks. 
                             <strong>I was blown away when I read this 
                             in a book about children that are now 80+ years old.</strong>
                            <br>
                            Once again, I was seeing the concept of using a concrete experience
                             to learn about letters and numbers, as a foundation to 
                            build upon, in order to be able to develop abstract thinking. <strong>It was wonderful.  </strong>
                            <br>I have not tested it yet with my son, but both examples made it very clear that the best way 
                            to see the “picture” behind an equation and understand the beauty of mathematics, is through the use of 
                            concrete experiences.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Finally, I decided to give it a go at deriving (A+B)<sup>2</sup> 
                            in a way that I can use to teach my son in the near future (or using Montessori's approach, to 
                            help him learn by himself...).

                                they can have a concrete experience of what (A+B)<sup>2</sup>  means. For older children 
                                (and adults) one can then use this experience to see the “picture” behind an equation.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Why do kids love chocolate and always want more? 
                            From a neurological point of view, the brain is hit with a 
                            chemical called dopamine, which gives them a feeling of happiness and pleasure, 
                            that they want to repeat over and over again. 
                            The same thing happens, when someone 
                            finally achieves a hard goal or completes a difficult task.</br>
                            Going through these types of concrete experiences is a similar process: it 
                            creates a feeling of happiness (dopamine…) when you finally understand it. 
                            It then induces a person, to seek other concrete learning experiences, like the 
                            ones they just had. 
                            <strong>Learning becomes fun and a flywheel is created for lifelong development.</strong>
