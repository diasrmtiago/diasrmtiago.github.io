                            and Account Payable for a young startup and explains how to automate some of the steps.

                            On this note we are going to drill down on the operations for the cash flows of a young

                            Cashflows are thus equal to cash inflows from clients relating to revenues net 
                            of cash outflows paid to suppliers. As a reminder, a common source of mistakes in 
                            numbers is to represent both as positive numbers and subtract them; to avoid this, 
                            one should represent cash inflows as a positive number (e.g £100) and cash outflows as 
                            a negative number (e.g (£20)) and then ADD both numbers to get to cash flows (£80 = £100 + (£20)).

                            Whenever there is revenue earned, there will be an invoice sent to a 
                            client requesting payment for the service or product and the amount is 
                            recognised in the P&L statement.  Accounts Receivables (“AR”) thus relates to 
                            client invoices for which payment has not been received yet. These show up as a 
                            current asset in the balance sheet (i.e. cash inflow expected soon).

                            Operationally, it will be the bookkeeper's responsibility to do 
                            the bookkeeping (i.e. recognise revenues in the accounting system), 
                            generate an invoice, send it to the client and match the cash inflow to the outstanding invoice.

                            First let's lay out the process that requires improvement.
                            <ul align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> supplier sends an invoice to an employee at the Company 
                                    (the one that requested the service or goods). In some situations, 
                                    this is sent to Finance who then needs to figure out who should approve it internally.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> the employee may exchange several emails with the supplier 
                                    if there are mistakes in the invoice.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> the employee then forwards the approved invoice to an email 
                                    distribution list which forward’s emails to an Optical Recognition System (OCR) to digitalise the invoice. 
                                    This is then push to the accounting system (Xero below in this example)
                                    <ul align="justify">
                                        <li>
                                            There is risk that an unapproved invoices get sent to the accounting 
                                            system as the OCR as not checks in place for emails received
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>    
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> there is typically a weekly pay run to pay approved invoices due
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> there is one payment set up in the online banking system, 
                                    for each invoice, which is very time consuming.
                                </li>

                                    ) that deals with the OCR.

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>  AP systems automatically upload invoices to the platform.

                                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> AP systems allow to set up workflows based on different rules

                                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once approved goes to the bookkeeper.  There is NO risk 
                                    that an unapproved invoices get sent to the accounting system as otherwise it would not receive it.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bookkeeper pushes approved invoices to the accounting system.

                            This is a much more automated process and it is much less likely that there will be any mistakes done. 
                            It takes only minutes (instead one hour or more) to do the payrun. The final step to fully automate this 
                            is to make payments from the AP platform which will be launched soon.
