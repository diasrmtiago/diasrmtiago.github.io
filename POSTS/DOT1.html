                        <p align="justify"><strong>Too long; Didn't read.</strong> 
                        </br> The moment in time when a company runs out of cash (runway) is determined by two key levers - 
                        Contribution Margin (CM) and Overheads.  
                        </br> Extending the runway can be achieved through a combination of lower growth 
                        (positive impact in CM in the short term) and a reduction of Overheads. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Runway > Run out of Cash</h2>
                        <p align="justify">Runway is defined as how long can a Company operate until it runs out of 
                            cash and is usually expressed in months. The implied assumption is that Cashflows, 
                            i.e. the difference between revenues and costs, are negative and therefore operations are being 
                            funded by cash at the bank,  the source of which was likely an equity raise in the past.  
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 1: Cashflows.</span>
                        <p align="justify">For example if a company has £1.2m of cash and is burning £100k 
                            per month its runway is 12 months.   
                        </p>
                        <!-- CM + OVERHEADS-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cashflows > Contribution Margin (CM) plus Overheads</h2>
                        <p align="justify">In order to link Cashflows with the operations of a Company, in a way
                             that non-finance people can relate to in their day to day activities, it is very helpful
                              to break it down in a slightly different way: Contribution Margin and  Overheads.  
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 2: Cashflows = CM + Overheads.</span>
                        <p align="justify">Contribution Margin (CM) is calculated as revenues net of CM costs. 
                            These are costs that a corporation needs to incur in order to generate revenues, 
                            so they grow in line with sales. It can either be a cash inflow (if positive when 
                            revenues cover CM costs) or cash outflow (if negative).
                           </p>
                        <p align="justify">Overheads (Ovh) are all other cash outs that the Company pays, 
                            regardless of the revenues generated. Over time, its growth should decouple from sales. 
                           </p>

                           <!-- CM OVER TIMES-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Contribution Margin Over Time</h2>
                        <p align="justify">There are typically be three phases for CM in a high growth startup:  
                            <ol align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Phase #1</strong> - because it takes some time for revenues to ramp 
                                    up while costs start to be incurred from day one (e.g hire a 
                                    sales team - salaries are paid day one but revenues may only 
                                    start to be generated in month six), CM is initially negative 
                                    and progressively trends towards zero. Cash burn (CM+Overheads) is at its maximum in this phase.</li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #2</strong> - revenues keep ramping up and CM becomes increasingly positive. Cash burn reduces.</li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #3</strong> - revenues cannot increase any longer without increasing further CM 
                                    costs, as a consequence CM plateaus. Cash burn is minimised.</li>
                              </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">To illustrate this, let’s consider a hypothetical Company that has just 
                            one sales person. The salary of that person is always (£1k) per month and 
                            there are some one-offs between (£1-2k) each month for the first 4-6 months. 
                            Given the way this specific industry works, it takes 6 months to generate sales 
                            and on a run-rate basis the Agent can generate £2k of sales per month. </p>

                            <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3: Contribution Margin Phases #1/#2/#3. </span>

                            <ol align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Phase #1</strong>  - CM starts at (£3k) and as one-off costs elapse and 
                                    revenues start to ramp it takes c. 6 months to achieve CM=0.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #2</strong>  - From month 6 onwards, revenues keep ramping up and by month ~11 
                                    the agent is now generating £2k of revenues per month. CM increases towards £1k.</li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #3</strong> - From month 11 onwards, the agent is not able to bring in 
                                    more revenues, CM is now at its run-rate level of £1k per month (£2k revenues net of 
                                    £1k salary).
                                </li>
                              </ol>
                        <p align="justify">In the figure below it is shown an example for the overall cash burn assuming (£20k) of overheads. 
                            At the start of Phase 1 burn is at its maximum (£23k), reduces to (£20k) in Phase 2 and finally 
                            plateaus at (£19k) in Phase 3.</br>
                            It is important to notice that a run-rate CM of £1k is not sufficient to cover (£20k) of 
                            Overheads. Further growth (or Overheads reduction) is necessary for the Company to hit breakeven.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Investing For Growth > Maximum Investment and Payback Period</h2>
                        <p align="justify"> While CM is negative, the Company needs to fund the cash outflow from cash 
                            at the bank. The time period required to hit CM=0 will determine what is the maximum investment necessary to grow the business - in this case it was £10k at month 7.</p>
                            <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P5.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 5: Total Investment and Payback period.  </span>
                        <p align="justify">Another important parameter is how long it takes to recover the initial 
                            investment, ie the payback period. Given that the run-rate CM is £1k it should take 
                            another ~10 months to fully recover the £10k investment, so overall, there is cash “tied-up” 
                            to grow the business for ~18 months.</br>
                            This is what it means to invest for growth - the higher the growth, the more cash will be necessary to fund the incremental burn due to the negative CM period.
                        </p>

                         <!-- ACHIEVE BREAKEVEN-->
                         <h2 class="section-heading">What is required to achieve breakeven?</h2>
                         <p align="justify">If Overheads are (£20k) and run-rate CM is £1k, the Company needs 
                            to grow CM to £20k and hire in total 20 Agents.  The maximum investment per Agent 
                            is £10k, hence the total funding required should be less than £200k (20x£10k).</BR>
                             If it takes ~18 months to fully recover the investment, up to ~£350k (18x£20k) would be 
                             required to cover Overheads for this period.</BR>
                            So overall, the total funding required to achieve positive cash flows should be 
                            less than £550k (£350k+£200k). </br>This amount can then be compared with the current
                             cash position at the bank. For example if cash available was £240k, runway would
                              be less than 12 months (£240k / £20k Overheads) and therefore it would not have 
                              enough time to hit breakeven.
                            </p>

                             <!-- GROWTH VS RUNWAY-->
                         <h2 class="section-heading">How does growth impact the runway?</h2>
                         <p align="justify">Lets consider the cumulative cash burn for two scenarios, 
                            where the Company has £375k cash at the bank.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Scenario #1 (slow growth)</strong>- hire 20 Agents in 12 months @ 1-2 per month
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Scenario #2 (high growth) </strong>- hire 20 Agents in 6 months @ 1-5 per month
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                              <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P6.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 6: Cumulative cashburn for each scenario.  </span>
                        <p align="justify">The first conclusion is that growth increases burn in the short term
                             (red line is to the left of the green line) and reduces the funding requirements 
                             in the long term (£423k vs £482k). However, because of this increase in burn, 
                             another consequence is that the runway will be shortened - in the high growth scenario 
                             this is ~9mths vs ~12 months in the slow growth scenario. </p>

                              <!-- RUNWAY VS CAPITAL MARKETS-->
                         <h2 class="section-heading">How to think about runway vs capital markets conditions?</h2>
                         <p align="justify">In normal capital markets conditions, 
                            where there is plenty of money from investors, startups will typically go 
                            for higher growth (if they can…) because there is little risk of not being able
                             to raise additional money in the future to extend the runway.</BR></BR>
                            In capital market conditions like those experienced from mid 2022, where 
                            access to new money is likely to be constrained for a significant time period, 
                            it is wise to extend the runway as much as possible. </BR></BR>
                            This can be achieved through a combination of lower growth (positive impact in CM in the short term) and a reduction
                             of Overheads as per the example below (red line = hire 20 Agents in 15 months and reduce Overheads by 25%).
