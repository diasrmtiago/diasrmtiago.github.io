                            as a simple way to think about a Company's profitability. This will then be applied to specific business

                            Let’s imagine a hypothetical scenario with two companies:  
                            <ol align="justify">
                                <li>From a revenue perspective, both companies have exactly the same revenues and growth profile.</li>
                                <li>From a contribution margin and a profit/(loss) perspective, Company Two’s financials are slightly worse. </li>                      
                        </ol>
                        How can one determine which company is scaling sustainably and which one is not?
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Contribution Margin per “Unit of Cost”</h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The first step is to split CM costs in two buckets: 
                            (i) 100% variable regardless of revenue level and 
                            (ii) fixed costs up until a certain revenue level. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT3/img/D3P2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 2: CM cost buckets.</span>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The second step is to then analyse each bucket independently:
                            <ol align="justify">
                                <ul align="justify"> 
                                    <li><Strong>Fixed CM costs:</Strong> the company pays for this cost within a certain capacity figure linked to revenues. 
                                        For example, it could be the salary of a sales person. The agent can bring in up to a certain revenue
                                         level; every month the revenue generated changes but the salary paid remains the same. This is a 
                                         simplification, as in practice there are several “Fixed CM costs”, each incurred for up to a certain revenue level.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Variable CM costs:</strong>  this could be for example an agreed % of revenues paid 
                                    out as bonus to sales agents. Given that it is variable, it protects margins 
                                    and therefore profitability whenever there is a decrease in revenues. However, 
                                    it cannot be so high that nothing is left for the Company.</li>
                            </ol>
                        Coming back to the original question, below is an overview of the CM costs for Company 1 and Company 2. 
                        For either company a sales person can get each month one to six new clients. The typical performance for
                         80% of the people is 2-3 clients per month. 
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT3/img/D3P3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3: CM per sales person for Company 1 and Company 2.</span>
                        <ol align="justify">
                            <ul align="justify"> 
                            <li><strong>Fixed CM costs: </strong>  given the higher revenue per client, Company One has an advantage 
                                over Company Two (25% vs 45% of revenues).</li>
                            <li><Strong>Variable CM costs:</Strong> it is very clear that Company One’s costs 
                                are simply too high at 80% of revenues (vs 40% for Company Two). 
                            </li>
                        </ol>                          

                        <p align="justify">
                            Even with a more favourable position from a fixed costs perspective, 
                            <strong>it will be impossible to become profitable, given that for each sales person
                             (or unit cost), Company One has a loss of (£600-1,400)</strong>. If they add more 
                             sales people, revenues will grow but the loss will only become worse over time.<br>
                            It is very interesting to notice that many times important questions about a business’ 
                            profitability can be determined using a few key numbers. It is not necessary to use a complex spreadsheet 
                            to draw conclusions.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">
                            Coming back to the previous example, over a 24 months period, 
                            both companies grew their revenues at exactly the same pace (from £79k to £2.7m) 
                            but the CM profile was completely different. By month 12, one would think that Company Two 
                            was in trouble but in fact a few quarters later, it managed to grow 
                            CM to cover Overheads.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Based on the previous section, this is not a surprise, 
                            as Company One made a loss of (£600-1,400) per sales person per month, 
                            while <strong>Company Two was digging out of a hole (see figure below) as it 
                            grew its revenues and CM,</strong> as the number of sales people increased.
