                             with numbers and mathematics and use them to learn and think about
                              the World and avoid falling into the trap of memorising instead of understanding.
                            <br>A simple concept with profound implications that should be much more widely shared with others.

                        <p align="justify">
                            A long time ago, when I was in University, I unfortunately saw many times some of my 
                            colleagues struggling with equations because they could not understand the intuition 
                            behind the numbers. They would memorise things but did not grasp the concepts. They 
                            could not see the “picture” behind an equation and understand the beauty of mathematics, 
                            as everything was abstract and disconnected from the real World.
                            <br>My son Santiago will soon turn four. I often think about his education and how I can support 
                            him in this journey. 
                            In particular, in how he can make sense of numbers and use them to learn and think about the 
                            World and avoid falling into the trap of memorising instead of understanding.  
                            <br><strong>If you are reading this and have children you probably relate to this feeling.</strong>

                        <p align="justify">
                            I recently came across a podcast called 
                            <a href="https://www.thelongtimeacademy.com/" target="_blank">Long Time Academy</a> 
                            (I highly recommended it, in particular the point about thinking about future generations 
                            in today’s decisions), where they discussed an experience called 
                            <a href="https://www.deeptimewalk.org" target="_blank">Deep Time Walk</a>. 
                             
                            In it, they explain how Earth is 4,600 million years old and how from this long time perspective,
                             the last 100 years are just a blink of an eye (they equate to 0.00000002% of all time elapsed so far) 
                             and that this is an abstract concept that people cannot relate to. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT4/img/D4P1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 1: Earth is 4.6bn years old.</span>
                        <p align="justify">
                            It suggests going for a walk of 4,600 metres.
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT4/img/D4P2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 2: 1 metre = 1 million years.</span>                     

                        <p align="justify">
                            On average it will take about one hour to do the walk, which means the last metre 
                            takes approximately one second to cover with one step. But that very last step equals 
                            the last one million years, a tiny bit of the step (10cm) equates to 100,000 years and a 
                            very very tiny bit of the step equates (1cm) to 1,000 years.<br><strong> This then makes the last 100 years 
                            (the 0.00000002%) a very concrete experience that people can relate to and understand how really, 
                            really, really short this time period was in the grand scheme of things (and how quickly we are damaging the World for future generations...)</strong>. 
                            <br>My next thought was that this experience works for both adults and children. 
                            I was wondering if there were other “experiences” out there similar to this one?

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Maria Montessori</h2>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The second step in my journey was when I randomly found Maria Montessori’s book in a bookstore. 
                            In it, the famous author describes how through using their hands, children aged 3-6 years learned
                             how to write words as they picked up wooden letters and how they tried to figure out what 
                             (A+B+C)<sup>3</sup> equates to by using wooden tri-dimensional blocks. <strong>I was blown away when I read this 
                             in a book about children that are now 80 years (or more).</strong>
                            <br>
                            Once again, I was seeing the concept of using a concrete experience to learn about letters and numbers as a foundation to 
                            build upon in order to be able to develop abstract thinking. <strong>It was wonderful.  </strong>
                            <br>I have not tested it yet with my son but both examples made it very clear that the best way 
                            to see the “picture” behind an equation and understand the beauty of mathematics is through the use of 
                            concrete experiences and this can be done from a very young age.

                        <p align="justify">
                            Finally, I decided to give it a go at deriving (A+B)<sup>2</sup> 
                            in a way that I can use to teach my son in the near future. If you also have children please do keep reading.

                                <br>This is where the magic happens. For very small children who have not learned the numbers yet, 
                                they can have a concrete experience to understand what (A+B)<sup>2</sup>  means. For older children 
                                (and adults) one can then use this experience to see the “picture” behind an equation.
