                            same way, i.e. revenues net of costs, but they

                            revenues and costs based on when they are respectively received (cash revenues) or paid (cash costs).

                        <p align="justify">Let's use an example to make it easier to understand. 
                            During a certain year, a Company has the following cash transactions:
                        </p>
                        <ol align="justify">
                            <li>Cash revenues client 1 = £100 received in month 3</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 2 = £100 received in month 6</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 3 = £100 received in month 9</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 4 = £100 received in month 12</li>
                            <li>Cash revenues client 5 = £100 received in month 15</li>
                            <li>Costs Costs = (£30) paid in month 4; (£30) paid in month 7;(£30) paid in month 10
                                 and (£30) paid in month 13</li>                         
                          </ol>
                          <p align="justify"><strong>The Cashflows for the year would thus be £310</strong> = £400 cash revenues
                             minus £90 cash costs. Any revenue (cost) received (paid) post month 12 does not count towards the yearly figure.
                           In this example, the <strong>£100 cash revenues from client 5 in month 15 and 
                            the (£30) cash costs in month 13 would be excluded.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify"><strong>Profit and Loss (P&L) basis</strong> <br>There are rules, 
                            based on different accounting standards, that stipulate when revenue is earned 
                            and when costs are incurred.
                            
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT2/img/D2P3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

                        <p align="justify">
                            <strong>Cashflows can be derived from Profits if one takes into account the time impact of 
                            (i) receiving revenues vs earning them and (ii) paying costs vs incurring them, i.e.
                            <u>Cashflows = Profits + time impact. </u></strong>
                       </p>

                       <p align="justify">Going back to the previous example</p>
                       <ol align="justify">
                        <li> P&L Revenue client 1 = £100 earned in month 1 (received in month 3)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 2 = £100 earned in month 3 (received in month 6)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 3 = £100 earned in month 6 (received in month 9)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 4 = £100 earned in month 9 (received in month 12)</li>
                        <li>P&L Revenue client 5 = £100 earned in month 12 (received in month 15) </li>
                        <li>Quarterly P&L Costs = (£30) incurred per quarter, paid after quarter end</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>The profit for the year would thus be £380</strong>  = £500 P&L revenues minus £120 P&L costs.
                    </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 4: Cashflow basis vs P&L basis.</span>

                       <p align="justify">Let's keep going through the previous example:</p>
                    <ol align="justify">
                        <li><strong>From a revenue perspective</strong>, the company received £400 cash revenues (client 5 was paid after year end) 
                            and earned £500 of revenues from 5 clients. 
                            <strong><br>The time impact was thus (£100) relating to the £100 from client 5 that was earned in month 12 but was

                        <li><strong>From a cost perspective</strong>, it paid out three quarters (£90) but incurred 
                            (£120) relating to four quarters. 
                            <strong><br>The time impact was thus £30 relating to fourth quarter costs incurred during the quarter

                      </ol>
                      <p align="justify"><strong>The overall time impact was thus (£70k)=(£100)+£30.</strong></p>

                    <!-- SECTION 2-->
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Step 2<br>Balance Sheet = Keep a Score Sheet</h2>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        In the prior sections, we have discussed two simplified versions of 
                        the financial statements of a Company for a certain time period:
                        <ol align="justify">
                            <li><strong>Cashflows</strong> = net change in cash position for the period
                                </li>
                            <li><strong>P&L</strong> = profit or loss for period</li>
                        </ol>    
                    </p> 
                    
                    
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        To tie everything together we need to introduce a third financial statement, 
                        called the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>.</p> 

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Let’s connect sports and accounting (ugh how is that possible?).</br></br>
                        Pick any sport you like that has two teams 
                         and think about the beginning of the match: nothing has happened and therefore there is no score. 
                        Over time each team will score points and the Score Sheet is updated accordingly. 
                         At the end of the match there will be a final Score Sheet, which
                          includes the sum of all the points scored for each team. </br><strong>A Balance Sheet works the same, and at any moment in time 
                          it provides a snapshot of the running score between two teams (albeit the score,
                           or balance, is shown in a slightly different way). </br>There are four fundamental archetypes 
                           that can be used to cover the vast majority of transactions in a Company. </strong>
                           
                        </p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        <strong>Archetype #1 > Revenues</strong><br>
                         Going back to the original example in this note, what would the final Score Sheet
                         look like for each revenue "team" at the end of the year (month 12)?
                            <strong></strong>
                            </p>
                       
                    <center>TEAM CASH REVENUES score = £400 </br>vs TEAM P&L REVENUES score = £500</center>
                    <p align="justify">
                        TEAM P&L REVENUES thus wins the game by a margin of £100. In accounting terms however, 
                        the overall game score or Balance Sheet is shown in a slightly different way 
                        (after all this is accounting stuff…):</br>
                        <center>TEAM CASH REVENUES score of £400 + £100 = </br>
                            TEAM P&L REVENUES score  £500</center>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        The <strong>Score Sheet (i.e. Balance Sheet)</strong> for the game is shown as:
                    </p>
                    <ul align="justify"> 
                    
                        <li> <strong>Assets</strong> - cash or assets that will 
                    convert into cash at the bank in the future</li>
                    <li><strong>Liabilities</strong> - amounts that will have to be paid from cash at the bank in the future </li>
                        
                    <li><strong>Equity</strong> - balancing item 
                        to make sure that the equation below balances </li>                        
                        </ul>
                    <p align="justify"> 
                        <center><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></center></br>
                            Notice that this can be re-written as below:
                            <center><strong></br>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</strong></center>
                                      
                        </p> 

                    <p align="justify"> 
                        Equity can thus be interpreted as the residual claim that 
                    Shareholders will have on a Company's Assets net of its Liabilities. Whatever is left 
                    would be owed to them, to compensate for the risk taken when they invested in the Company. 
                </br><strong>Equity may be a negative figure</strong>, when losses incurred over time are greater than the 
                    initial Equity investment from Shareholders - in this situation the Company is 
                    <strong>insolvent</strong> which is a red flag. When this happens it is very likely that within 12 months
                    the Company becomes <strong>iliquid and runs out of 
                    cash to pay the Bills. To put it in another way, Runway is equivalent to when 
                    the Company will become iliquid. The Balance Sheet can thus be analysed in order
                    to determine the financial strength of a Company. </strong>

                        <p align="justify">You may have heard in the past the term “Working Capital” and 
                            searched online the term to get the below:

                                The following figure is replicating the balance sheet from the previous section, with two small changes:
                                
                            </p>

                                <li>Assets were split into two lines: (i) <strong>current assets (CA)</strong> which are

                                <li>Liabilities were split into two lines: (i) <strong>current liabilities (CL) </strong>which means

                        <p align="justify">At the start the period CA = 0 and CL = 0 hence Working Capital 
                            whic is defined as the difference between CA and CL was zero. However at the end of the period, CA increased to £100 and 
                            CL increased to £30 hence Working Capital increased from £0 to £70. 
                            Does this number look familiar? <br>
                            <strong>Hopefully yes… this figure is the time impact for the period,
                                 £70 = £100 time impact 
                            from revenues net of £30 time impact from costs. Therefore, one concludes the following relationship
                            between the three financial statements:</br> </strong>

                        <p align="justify">Why is Current Assets minus Current Liablities called Working Capital?<br>
                            The figure below is plotting the cumulative Profits and Cashflows on a monthly basis between 
                            month 1 and month 15.<br>

                            If revenues were received as soon as they were earned and costs were paid as soon as they were
                            incurred, the pink line for the cash position over time would exactly match the green line for the cumulative Profits. <br>
                            There is typically a delay between (i) earning and receiving revenues (Current Asset) and 
                            (ii) incurring and paying for costs (Current Liability), and as a consequence the cash position 
                            ends up being lower.
                            The delta between the two lines represents cash tied up in the Company's operations that cannot be used to pay
                            the bills.<br>
                            <strong>Replace the words "cash" by "Capital" and "operations" by "Working" and reverse the order and you get to what 
                            is called Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities.</strong> 
                            <br>Notice that in month 15 the delta between both lines collapses to zero because there
                             are no more revenues or costs to be received or paid. 
                             This implies that the Company would cease operations; in practice what would happen is 
                             that it would continue to generate revenues and incurs costs (with delays to receive and pay) 
                             and there would be an ongoing Working Capital level since the lines would never cross. <br>

                        <p align="justify">There are two remaining archetypes: <br>
                            i) Cash revenues are received before they were actually earned (think SaaS

                            In both cases, there is no P&L impact since there is

                                There is a slightly different version of the prior archetype. 
                                This relates to when cash is spend to purchase an asset that will be used for 
                                several years to generate additional cashflows. <br>
                                In this situation, the cash cost is
                                    called "Capital Expenditure" or "Capex". If we use the same example, cashflows decreased by e.g £100.
                                 In the Balance Sheet cash decreases by the same amount and non-current assets (since it relates to more than one) 
                                 increase by £100. <br>

                    Given that the cash spent on the new asset, shows up in the balance as a non-current asset, the equation that relates
                    Cashflows to Profits needs to be updated to include "Capex", as this is not picked up by the change in Working 
                    Capital. <br>
