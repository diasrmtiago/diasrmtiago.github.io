                            Everything starts with what is called the chart of accounts as per the figure below.
                         </p>

                        <p align="justify">                         
                            The chart of accounts consists of several accounts relating to P&L (revenues or costs) 
                            and balance sheet (“BS”) items (assets, liabilities and equity). Each account has a unique 
                            code (e.g 200) and a name (e.g revenues).<br>
                            Whenever there is a transaction, a bookkeeper will use a dual entry system whereby it 
                            will debit an account and credit another account. This means a positive number in one of 
                            the accounts, and a negative number on the other account, so that the <strong>sum of both entries 
                            is always zero. </strong>
                         </p>
                         <p align="justify">                         
                            Let's use an example for clarity. For a certain time period there are two transactions:
                            <ul align="justify">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Transaction #1:</strong> £100 of revenue recognised which was not received yet. 
                                    P&L Account 200 (revenue) is credited with £100 and BS account 601 (other assets) 
                                    is debited with £100 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Transaction #2:</strong> £20 of costs incurred but not paid yet. P&L Account 300 (cost) is 
                                    debited with £20 and BS account 701 (Liabilities) is credited with £20 
                                </li>
                            </ul>    
                         </p>
                         <p align="justify">  
                            These two transactions would show up as below. Notice that each column always needs to add up zero. 
                            The total column is also known as <strong>“Trial Balance”</strong> or “TB”.

                            determine P&L between period 1 & 3 and the BS at the end of period 3 (see tab "1.CoA" in this

                            <strong>It is very important to bear in mind that one should also look at the cashflow statement to

                            This can be derived using the indirect method as explained in

                            Personally, I prefer to use the direct method and set up a cashburn report in the accounting system 
                            (e.g Xero) where I can get the cash revenues, cash costs and other cash items. I also have an 
                            independent cash tracker with all the inflows and outflows of each bank account and use it to 
                            cross check the cash position and cashburn.

                            A chart of accounts is not just 10 accounts as in the previous example. 
                            In practice, there will be several revenue streams, costs and balance sheet items, 
                            all of which will have a specific nature (and therefore account). <br>
                            It should be as granular as necessary so that Financial Reporting can be used not only 
                            to think about the business on a high level basis but also to support the details required 
                            for Financial Planning. <strong>It is key that the financial reporting team (past) and FP&A teams 
                            (future) are closely aligned on this.</strong><br>
                            The chart of accounts can be used to produce different types of reports using a 
                            matrix: the vertical dimension being the accounts and the horizontal dimension 
                            being different report formats (see example below).

                                    running a checklist for quality control of numbers.

                             A key blocker here is moving data out of the accounting system  automatically and ensuring

                            I have built some dummy TB numbers for 
                            two years - 2021 and 2022. These are all in £ (i.e. not rounded in £000s or £millions) 
                            and notice that each column adds up to zero (otherwise there would be a mistake).

                            The next step is to create an engine tab (see “TBEngine”
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wtwsuA7108sXxuvuYwcvxQmCuBLIxTwc2uqS9JiSJtg/edit#gid=221489112" target="_blank">here</a>) 
                            to process the raw trial balance data. This entails two main tasks. 
                            Firstly, the detailed chart of matrix data is used to aggregate numbers into 
                            higher level categories. Secondly, the cumulative TB data is manipulated to 
                            calculate the P&L information for each month.

                            Finally, the management accounts are automatically created using the 
                            data processed in the engine tab (see tab “Management Accounts” 
                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wtwsuA7108sXxuvuYwcvxQmCuBLIxTwc2uqS9JiSJtg/edit#gid=222650702" target="_blank">here</a>).  
                            Notice how it is possible to i) automatically see the reporting in £ or £000s 
                            using the “factor” cell and ii) switch between monthly, quarterly or annually views.

                            This process can be replicated to produce financial statements for a certain GAAP.

                        <p align="justify">  
                            There are two routes to automate the data transfer between the accounting system and 
                            a google sheet. <br>
                            First option is to get support from your engineering team to set up data pipes - 
                            there will likely be push back on this option as engineering resources are typically scarce 
                            (I have done a simple Google Apps script to link to Xero’s API which I will share in the future). <br>
                            The second (easier) option is to search for a provider that can link to your accounting 
                            system and move  the data around. In my case, my accounting system is Xero and I use 
                            <a href="https://www.g-accon.com/" target="_blank">G-accon</a>
                             to automate the data transfer. <br>
                            My financial statements are thus live and synchronised with Xero and not manual work is required from me.

                        <!-- Final Considerations - Consolidation-->
                        <h1 > Final Considerations</h1>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The above note assumes only one legal entity and one currency, which is the simplest case 
                            possible. As a company scales, this will most likely not be the case and the accounting 
                            system will need to be able to deal with multi-entities and multi-currency.<br>
                            The principle remains the same though, i.e. replicate the process above for each 
                            legal entity and ensure that there is a final layer to do the consolidation across the group. <br>
                            The consolidation process can be fairly complex depending on the 
                            volume of intercompany transactions. Furthermore, as some (most?) 
                            accounting systems are not built to provide this layer relating to consolidation, 
                            it may entail getting support from a specific software provider (e.g 
                            <a href="https://www.getmayday.com/" target="_blank">MayDay</a>).
