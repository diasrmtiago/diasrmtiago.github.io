                        <h1 > Summary</h1>
                        <p align="justify">In mid 2022, we are experiencing difficult capital markets conditions, where 
                        access to new capital will likely to be constrained in the near term. In such an environment,
                        it is wise to extend runway and target profitability sooner.</br> 
                        This note explains why this can be achieved through a combination of lower growth 
                        and a reduction of Overheads.  </p>                

                        
                        <!-- CASHFLOWS-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Runway > Run out of Cash</h2>
                        <p align="justify">Runway is defined as how long can a Company operate until it runs out of 
                            cash and is usually expressed in months. The implied assumption is that Cashflows, 
                            i.e. the difference between revenues and costs, are negative and therefore operations are being 
                            funded by cash at the bank. 
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 1: Cashflows.</span>
                        <p align="justify">For example, if a company has £1.2m of cash and is burning £100k 
                            per month its runway is 12 months.   
                        </p>
                        <!-- CM + OVERHEADS-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cashflows > Contribution Margin (CM) plus Overheads</h2>
                        <p align="justify">In order to link Cashflows with the operations of a Company, in a way
                             that non-finance people can relate to, in their day to day activities, it is very helpful
                              to break it down in a slightly different way: Contribution Margin and  Overheads.  
                        </p>
                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 2: Cashflows = CM + Overheads.</span>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>Contribution Margin (CM)</strong> is calculated as revenues net of CM costs. 
                            These are costs that a Company needs to incur in order to generate revenues, 
                            so they grow in line with sales.<strong> It can either be a cash inflow (if positive when 
                            revenues cover CM costs) or cash outflow (if negative)</strong>.
                           </p>
                        <p align="justify"><strong>Overheads</strong> are all other cash outs that the Company pays, 
                            regardless of the revenues generated. Over time, its growth should decouple from sales. <strong> This 
                                component is always negative (i.e. a cash outflow).</strong>
                           </p>
                           
                          <p><strong>When a Company is burning cash ("cash burn") it
                            means that Cashflows are negative (i.e. CM+Overheads<0) </strong></p>
                           <!-- CM OVER TIMES-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Contribution Margin Over Time and Breakeven</h2>
                        <p align="justify">There are typically three phases for CM in a high growth startup:  
                            <ol align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Phase #1 (CM<0)</strong> - because it takes some time for revenues to ramp 
                                    up while costs start to be incurred from day one (e.g. hire a 
                                    sales team - salaries are paid day one but revenues may only 
                                    start to be generated in month six), CM is initially negative 
                                    and progressively trends towards zero.<strong> Cash burn is at its maximum.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #2 (CM positive)</strong> - revenues keep ramping up and CM becomes increasingly positive. 
                                <strong>Cash burn reduces.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #3 (CM at run-rate)</strong> - revenues cannot increase any longer without increasing further CM 
                                    costs, as a consequence CM plateaus.  <strong>Cash burn is minimised.</strong></li>
                              </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">To illustrate this, let’s consider a hypothetical Company 
                            with a sales team of just one person. The salary of that person is always (£1k) per month and 
                            there are some one-off costs between (£1-2k) each month for the first 6 months. </br>
                            Given the way this specific industry works, it takes 6 months to generate sales 
                            and on a run-rate basis the Agent can generate £2k of sales per month. </p>

                            <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3: Contribution Margin Phases #1/#2/#3. </span>

                            <ol align="justify">
                                <li><strong>Phase #1</strong>  - CM starts at (£3k) and as one-off costs elapse and 
                                    revenues start to ramp up, it takes c. <strong>6 months to achieve CM=0</strong>.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #2</strong>  - From month 6 onwards, revenues keep ramping up and by month ~11 
                                    the agent is now generating £2k of revenues per month. <strong>CM increases towards £1k</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Phase #3</strong> - From month 11 onwards, the agent is not able to bring in 
                                    more revenues, <strong>CM is now at its run-rate level of £1k per month (£2k revenues net of 
                                    £1k salary)</strong>.
                                </li>
                              </ol>
                        <p align="justify">In the figure below, it is shown an example for the overall cash burn assuming (£20k) 
                            of Overheads. 
                            At the start of Phase 1 burn is at its maximum (£23k), it then reduces to (£20k) in Phase 2 and finally 
                            plateaus at (£19k) in Phase 3.</br>
                                                        <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P4.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 4: Cash burn as CM goes through Phases #1/#2/#3.  </span>
                            It is important to notice that a run-rate CM of £1k is not sufficient to cover (£20k) of 
                                Overheads. <strong>Further growth or a Overheads reduction is necessary for the Company to hit <u>breakeven</u> 
                                (this means that Contribution Margin inflows match outflows for Overheads and therefore no cash is burn).</strong>
                                </p>
                           <!-- Invest for growth-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Investing For Growth > Maximum Investment and Payback Period</h2>
                        <p align="justify"> While CM is negative, the Company needs to fund the cash outflow from cash 
                            at the bank. The time period required to hit CM=0 will determine what is the <strong>maximum 
                                investment necessary to grow the business - in this case it was £10k at month 7.</strong></p>
                            <a ><img class="img-fluid" src="../DOTFILES/DOT1/img/D1P5.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 5: Total Investment and Payback period.  </span>
                        <p align="justify">Another important parameter is <strong> how long it takes to recover the initial 
                            investment, ie the payback period</strong>. Given that the run-rate CM is £1k it should take 
                            another ~10 months to fully recover the £10k investment, so overall, <strong>there is cash “tied-up” 
                            to grow the business for ~18 months.</strong></br>
                            This is what it means to invest for growth - the higher the growth, the more cash will be necessary to 
                            fund the incremental burn due to the negative CM period during Phase 1.
                        </p>

                         <!-- ACHIEVE BREAKEVEN-->
                         <h2 class="section-heading">What is required operationally to achieve breakeven?</h2>
                         <p align="justify"><strong>If Overheads are (£20k) and run-rate CM is £1k, the Company needs 
                            to grow CM to £20k and hire in total 20 Agents in order to breakeven.</strong>  
                             </br>The maximum investment per Agent 
                            is £10k, hence the <strong>investment for growth will be less than £200k </strong>(20x£10k), as it will take
                            several months to hire all the Agents.
                             If it takes ~18 months to fully recover the investment, up to ~£360k (18x£20k) would be 
                             required to cover Overheads for this period.</BR>
                            So overall, the <strong>total funding required to achieve positive cash flows should be 
                            less than £560k </strong>(£200k for growth and £360k for Overheads). </p>
                            
                            <p align="justify">This amount can then be compared with the current
                                cash position at the bank to assess how feasible it is to achieve this milestone.</BR>
                               For example, if cash available was £240k, runway would
                                 be less than 12 months (£240k / £20k Overheads) and therefore it would not have 
                                 enough time to hit breakeven.
                               </p>

                            <p align="justify">Below is an example for a High Growth scenario where the 20 Agents are hired over
                                a 6 months period. As it takes ~11 months for an Agent to be fully ramped up (£1k CM), breakeven is 
                                achieved by month ~17. </p>

                         <p align="justify">Lets consider the cumulative cash burn for two scenarios, 
                            where the Company has £375k cash at the bank.</p>

                                <li><strong>Scenario #1 (slow growth)</strong>- hire 20 Agents in 12 months @ 1-2 per month

                             (red line is to the left of the green line), because more cash is required to invest for 
                             growth (CM<0 period), and
                             reduces the total funding requirement (£423k vs £482k) as a consequence of 
                             hitting breakeven sooner. 
                            </br>Another consequence is that for the same cash at the bank amount (£375k) the runway will be shortened - in the high growth scenario 
                             this is ~9mths vs ~12 months in the slow growth scenario. </p>

                             <p align="justify"><strong>In short, there is always a trade-off between growth and runway. Higher 
                                growth implies a shorter runway.  </strong></p>

                              <!-- RUNWAY VS CAPITAL MARKETS-->
                         <h2 class="section-heading">How to think about runway vs capital markets conditions?</h2>
                         <p align="justify">During normal capital markets conditions, 
                            when there is plenty of money from investors, startups will typically go 
                            for higher growth (if they can…) because there is little risk of not being able
                             to raise additional money in the future to extend the runway.</BR></BR>
                            During capital market conditions like those experienced from mid 2022, where 
                            access to new money is likely to be constrained for a significant time period, 
                            it is wise to extend the runway as much as possible. </BR></BR>
                            This can be achieved through a combination of lower growth 
                             and a reduction
                             of Overheads. As per the example below for a Slower Growth scenario (red line = hire 20 Agents in 15 months 
                             and reduce Overheads by 25%), <strong>runway was extended from 9 months to 15 months while the cumulative
                                burn (total funding requirement) remained the same (£423k).</strong>
                            </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 8: Impact of growth and Overheads in runway.  </span>

                            <p align="justify"><strong>Why did this happen?</strong></br> Obviously if less money is being 
                                spent on overheads, runway will be
                                extended. However, the other side of the coin is that in the High Growth scenario 
                                (20 hires in 6 months) there is a big mismatch 
                                between the investing cash for growth and starting to generate positive CM from those investments (see red line vs
                                green line on the picture on the left).</br> In the Slower Growth scenario (20 hires in 15 months), the initial investment is not as steep and 
                                from month ~15 ownards, the cash generated from a fully on-ramped Agent over two months (£10k), 
                                is sufficient to recover 100%
                                of the investment of launching one new Agent (£10k). </BR>
                                <strong> Cash in from older investments can thus be used to fund the cash investment in new Agents - 
                                    growth becomes very sustainable with no material cashburn.</strong>
